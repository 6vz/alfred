## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alfred.git
   cd alfred
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create your `.env` file
   ```env
   SECRET=dev-secret-key
   DEBUG=true
   PORT=8000
   ```

5. Run the development server
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Code Style

* Follow PEP 8 Python code style
* Use type hints where appropriate
* Write descriptive docstrings for functions and classes
* Keep functions small and focused
* Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure:

* Your code passes all existing tests
* You've added tests for new functionality
* Manual testing has been performed
* The server starts without errors

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
